            brand-new washing machines and dryers, along with great air
            conditioning to keep you comfortable even during the hottest summer
            days.

            Our coin-operated machines can handle laundry loads ranging from 20
            to 80 pounds, with prices starting at $3.00 and going up to $12.50.

            knowledgeable on-site attendant is available to help you out.

            With our Speed Queen Insights App, you can conveniently check
            machine availability either remotely or right in the store. Just
            select your machine by entering its number or scanning its QR code.
            After that, simply proceed by choosing your preferred settings, tap
            Continue, and press Start on the machine. Relax until the app alerts
            you when your laundry is nearing completion. Additionally, you'll
            earn reward points with every purchase, and your first $5.00 is
            complimentary!
