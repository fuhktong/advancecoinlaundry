          <p>The Hamilton Method will defeat the two-party system in the United States. Voters will be able to choose among many different parties. Most importantly, the Hamilton Method will prevent someone from winning a majority of electoral votes and force deliberation in an elector convention. <br/>The Framers’ Method is a political science education and reform-oriented channel. We want to inform and promote ideas that will defeat populism and tyranny as well as stabilize the American political system. It’s science, political science!</p>
