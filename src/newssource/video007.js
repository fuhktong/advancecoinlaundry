          <p>The impact of the Hamilton Method in American elections will be profound. We will gain a multiple-party system, reduce wasted votes, eliminate the wrong-winner scenario, prevent fraud in elections, reduce money in politics, protect national security, moderate candidate’s campaign behavior, and mitigate the battle over the national narrative. <br/>The Framers’ Method is a political science education and reform-oriented channel. We want to inform and promote ideas that will defeat populism and tyranny as well as stabilize the American political system. It’s science, political science!</p>
